New style:
- itunes parser?
- amazon parser?
- next parser?

- Parsers should throw exceptions for unparsed emails so that they are saved for debugging

- Handle currency conversion as purchases made in USD do not get matched correctly
- Handle subscription emails (text emails?)
- Handle email classification from subject rather than by gmail label
